What is pocketchain?
----------------

pocketchain is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. pocketchain uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. PocketChain Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the PocketChain Core software, see [https://www.pocketchain.org/](https://www.pocketchain.org/).
